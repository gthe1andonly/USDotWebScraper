## USDOT web scraper 

## Requirements:
#### Scrape Carrier Registration Details page for #### each operator in Motor Carrier Census Information file.
#### Need vehilcle type breakout table as well as list of cargo carried

#### Accessing the carrier regisration details: 
#### https://ai.fmcsa.dot.gov/SMS/Carrier/[DOT_NUMBER]/CarrierRegistration.aspx 
#### DOT number is a unique identifier for each carrier

## Running the code
#### 1. Download the project/repo
#### 2. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 
#### Ensure that python3 is already installed on your machine
#### 3. Using a cav file with the column name `U.S. DOT#:`, run the following command `python .\src\USDotScraperDriver.py -f filename.csv`
#### If you are in the src folder, ommit the src part in the command


## Design
#### The main components are broken down into 2 classes, web scraper class and the driver class.
#### The web scraper class has functions to make requests to the website and parse the webpage.
#### The driver class uses these functions to tie things together by reading from an input file,
#### using the driver class to obtain the info and placing those in output files. I have added comments
#### to both files to explain some choices I made such as logic and data structures.
